Implement a product, organize products in categories/collections, build a checkout flow (minus payment of course. No phi$hing guys!) We have no special products in mind. Find some fun examples online: T-shirts, hoodies, or maybe a bow tie. You can implement the products and categories/collections in a CMS, pull data from an Open Source API or implement them yourself, it is totally up to you how to get going.</p><p>The choice of solution, platform and technology is open. We don’t judge based on specific frameworks or languages. This gives you the freedom to solve the challenge as a website, a smartphone app or something crazy for your TV. Go ahead code something awesome. :)</p><p>The development challenge does not require any design or user interface design skills. In this challenge we are evaluating your coding skills, not your design skills. We recommend that you use a free template or copy-paste your layout/UI from somewhere nice.</p></div><div class="case__specifications"><h3>Your solution should contain:</h3><p><strong>Demo and code:</strong></p><p>Submit a link to your project and source.</p><p><strong>Optional extras</strong></p><p>If you run out of ideas but have time, consider these:</p><p>Make a product importer to import products into a new kind of storage and fetch the products from it. Implement single sign on using Facebook or other SoMe. Build a nice search-as-you-type feature. Implement caching of content that doesn’t change very often.</p></div><p>By the way: It is ok to submit a half-finished project. It is a whole lot better to submit something half-finished than submitting nothing. Last time the 2nd place was a half-finished project.</p></div><div class="submission"><h2 class="submission__title">Submissions</h2><form name="submission" netlify><div class="form-input required"><label>Full name(s)</label><input type="text" name="names" required></div><div class="form-input required"><label>E-mail</label><input type="email" name="email" required></div><div class="form-input required"><label>Phone Number</label><input type="text" name="phone" required></div><div class="form-input required"><label>Country</label><input type="text" name="country" required></div><div class="form-input required"><label>Solution</label><input type="file" name="solution" required></div><div class="form-input required"><label for="gdpr">GDPR</label><input type="checkbox" name="gdpr" id="gdpr" required><p class="form-input__help">I accept that Novicell will process my personal information such as full name, e-mail, phone number, country of residence and my solution until the 1st of June.
